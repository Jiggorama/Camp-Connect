## Code Showcase

> Conditional rendering on my site detail page.
```<>
    { campsite &&  
      
      <div className='site-detail'>
        <div className='img-container'>
          <img src={campsite.image} alt='No Image Provided' />
        </div>
        <div className='info-container'>
          <div className='sidebyside'>
          <div className='site-name'>{campsite.name}</div>
          {user && <>
            {campsite.users.some(camper => {
              return camper.id === user.id
            }) ?
            <div className = 'visited'>
                <div className='yes'>Visited</div>
                <div onClick={removeVisited} className='icon'><RemoveCircleOutlineIcon/></div>
              </div> :
              <div className = 'visited'>
                <div className='no'>Visited?</div>
                <div onClick={addVisited} className='icon'><AddCircleOutlineIcon/></div>
              </div>
            }
          </>}
          </div>
            <div className='description'>{campsite.description}</div>
        </div>
        <Comments campsite={campsite} user={user} setCampsite={setCampsite}/>
      </div>
    }
  </>```

## Code Issues & Resolutions

> Updating Campsite cuases rendering out of order
> Toggling visited changes comment render order
